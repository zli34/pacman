# pe-pacman
Pursuit and evasion implemented for Pacman.

## Installation
   - Install package dependencies: `npm install`.
     - Checks the `package.json` file and installs dependencies.

## Build the repo
   - Run: `npm run compile`.
     - This will create a `bundle.js` inside of the `build` directory.

## Start the web server
   - Run: `npm start`.
     - This will start a local web server on `127.0.0.1:8080`.
     - Navigate a browser to that url and you should see Pacman (or at least what has been finished so far...).
## Run the unit tests
   - Run: `npm test`.
     - Runs the Karma framework.
